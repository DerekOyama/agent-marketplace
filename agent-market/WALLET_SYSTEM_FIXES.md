# Wallet System Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive fixes applied to the execution history and wallet system to ensure accurate tracking of prices, balances, earnings, and payouts.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Price Update Issues ✅
**Problem**: Agent prices weren't being properly retrieved and used during execution
**Solution**: 
- Modified execution route to fetch agent price before credit check
- Ensured execution cost uses actual agent price instead of hardcoded default
- Added proper validation for price consistency

### 2. Balance Accuracy Issues ✅
**Problem**: Credit transactions and execution records weren't properly synchronized
**Solution**:
- Added balance tracking fields (`balanceBeforeCents`, `balanceAfterCents`) to execution records
- Ensured credit deduction happens before execution with proper error handling
- Added balance consistency validation

### 3. Earnings and Payouts Issues ✅
**Problem**: Revenue split calculations and user ID assignments were incorrect
**Solution**:
- Fixed earnings to use agent owner ID (not execution user ID)
- Ensured proper revenue split calculation (90% creator, 10% platform)
- Added transaction linking for proper audit trail

### 4. Database Consistency Issues ✅
**Problem**: Multiple systems updating data without proper coordination
**Solution**:
- Added proper transaction boundaries for critical operations
- Created validation scripts to check data consistency
- Added comprehensive error handling and rollback mechanisms

## Code Changes

### 1. Execution Route (`app/api/n8n/execute/route.ts`)
- **Lines 37-87**: Moved agent price retrieval before credit check
- **Lines 347-394**: Added proper credit deduction with error handling
- **Lines 396-416**: Added balance tracking to execution metrics
- **Lines 452-484**: Added balance tracking for failed executions

### 2. Metrics Collector (`lib/metrics-collector.ts`)
- **Lines 8-29**: Added balance tracking fields to ExecutionData interface
- **Lines 67-91**: Added balance fields to execution record creation
- **Lines 302-363**: Fixed metrics aggregation to use actual execution costs
- **Lines 97**: Updated metrics call to pass execution data

### 3. Payout Manager (`lib/payout-manager.ts`)
- **Lines 76-104**: Fixed earnings to use agent owner ID instead of execution user
- **Lines 111-115**: Added proper transaction linking for revenue split

## Validation Scripts

### 1. `scripts/validate-wallet-system.js`
Comprehensive validation script that checks:
- User credit balances against transaction history
- Execution costs against agent prices
- Earnings calculations accuracy
- Balance tracking consistency
- System summary statistics

### 2. `scripts/fix-wallet-inconsistencies.js`
Automated fix script that:
- Recalculates user balances from transaction history
- Updates execution costs to match agent prices
- Recalculates earnings based on actual execution data
- Updates agent metrics

### 3. `scripts/test-wallet-system.js`
Test script that:
- Creates test user and agent
- Simulates execution process
- Verifies all calculations
- Checks system consistency

## Database Schema Updates

The following fields are now properly tracked:
- `AgentExecution.balanceBeforeCents` - User balance before execution
- `AgentExecution.balanceAfterCents` - User balance after execution
- `Agent.pricePerExecutionCents` - Agent's execution price
- `AgentEarnings.userId` - Agent owner (not execution user)

## Testing Instructions

1. **Run validation script**:
   ```bash
   cd agent-market
   node scripts/validate-wallet-system.js
   ```

2. **Fix any inconsistencies**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/fix-wallet-inconsistencies.js
   ```

3. **Test the system**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/test-wallet-system.js
   ```

4. **Start local server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Key Improvements

1. **Accurate Price Tracking**: Agent prices are now properly retrieved and used
2. **Consistent Balance History**: All balance changes are tracked and validated
3. **Correct Earnings Calculation**: Revenue split is calculated accurately
4. **Proper User Attribution**: Earnings go to agent owners, not execution users
5. **Comprehensive Validation**: Multiple validation scripts ensure data integrity
6. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling prevents data corruption
7. **Transaction Safety**: Critical operations use database transactions

## Monitoring

The system now provides:
- Real-time balance tracking
- Accurate execution cost calculation
- Proper earnings attribution
- Comprehensive audit trail
- Data consistency validation

All changes maintain backward compatibility while significantly improving accuracy and reliability.
